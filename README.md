<h1><strong>Calculator Project</strong></h1><br>
This project is a simple but elegant looking calculator implemented using JavaScript. It includes the following functionalities:<br>
<br>
* Number input: You can input numbers by clicking on the number buttons.<br>
* Operator input: You can input operators (+, -, *, /) by clicking on the operator buttons.<br>
* Bracket input: You can input brackets ((), %) by clicking on the bracket buttons.<br>
* Clear screen: You can clear the screen by clicking on the "Clear" button.<br>
* Backspace: You can remove the last input by clicking on the "Backspace" button.<br>
* Calculate result: You can calculate the result of the input expression by clicking on the "Calculate" button.<br><br>
* Dynamic Calculation: The code will always give the output of expression dunamically.
<h2>Usage</h2><br>
To use the calculator, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. You can then interact with the calculator using the mouse or keyboard.<br>

<h2>Code Overview</h2>
The calculator is implemented using the following functions:<br>
<br>
* addonscreen(y): This function adds the input value y to the screen.<br>
* clearscreen(): This function clears the screen.<br>
* addoperator(y): This function adds the input operator y to the screen.<br>
* calc(): This function calculates the result of the input expression.<br>
* backspace(): This function removes the last input from the screen.<br>
* updateResult(): This function updates the result area with the result of the input expression.<br>
The functions use the document.getElementById() method to access the HTML elements and update their values. The eval() function is used to evaluate the input expression.<br>
<br>
<h2>Limitations</h2><br>
The calculator has the following limitations:<br>
<br>
* It does not handle invalid input expressions.<br>
* It does not handle division by zero.<br>
* It does not handle input expressions with unbalanced brackets.<br>
* It does not handle input expressions with more than one decimal point.<br>
* It does not handle input expressions with consecutive operators.<br>
<h2>Future Improvements</h2><br>
The calculator can be improved by adding error handling for invalid input expressions, division by zero, unbalanced brackets, multiple decimal points, and consecutive operators. <br>Additionally, the calculator can be improved by adding more functionalities such as scientific calculations, memory functions, and customizable themes.<br><br>
